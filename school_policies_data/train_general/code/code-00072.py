    Calculates ``element in test_elements``, broadcasting over `element` only.
    Returns a boolean array of the same shape as `element` that is True
    where an element of `element` is in `test_elements` and False otherwise.

    Parameters
    ----------
    element : array_like
        Input array.
    test_elements : array_like
        The values against which to test each value of `element`.
        This argument is flattened if it is an array or array_like.
        See notes for behavior with non-array-like parameters.
    assume_unique : bool, optional
        If True, the input arrays are both assumed to be unique, which
        can speed up the calculation.  Default is False.
    invert : bool, optional
        If True, the values in the returned array are inverted, as if
        calculating `element not in test_elements`. Default is False.
        ``np.isin(a, b, invert=True)`` is equivalent to (but faster
        than) ``np.invert(np.isin(a, b))``.
    kind : {None, 'sort', 'table'}, optional
        The algorithm to use. This will not affect the final result,
        but will affect the speed and memory use. The default, None,
        will select automatically based on memory considerations.

        * If 'sort', will use a mergesort-based approach. This will have
          a memory usage of roughly 6 times the sum of the sizes of
          `element` and `test_elements`, not accounting for size of dtypes.
        * If 'table', will use a lookup table approach similar
          to a counting sort. This is only available for boolean and
          integer arrays. This will have a memory usage of the
          size of `element` plus the max-min value of `test_elements`.
          `assume_unique` has no effect when the 'table' option is used.
        * If None, will automatically choose 'table' if
          the required memory allocation is less than or equal to
          6 times the sum of the sizes of `element` and `test_elements`,
          otherwise will use 'sort'. This is done to not use
          a large amount of memory by default, even though
          'table' may be faster in most cases. If 'table' is chosen,
          `assume_unique` will have no effect.


    Returns
    -------
    isin : ndarray, bool
        Has the same shape as `element`. The values `element[isin]`
        are in `test_elements`.

    Notes
    -----
    `isin` is an element-wise function version of the python keyword `in`.
    ``isin(a, b)`` is roughly equivalent to
    ``np.array([item in b for item in a])`` if `a` and `b` are 1-D sequences.

    `element` and `test_elements` are converted to arrays if they are not
    already. If `test_elements` is a set (or other non-sequence collection)
    it will be converted to an object array with one element, rather than an
    array of the values contained in `test_elements`. This is a consequence
    of the `array` constructor's way of handling non-sequence collections.
    Converting the set to a list usually gives the desired behavior.

    Using ``kind='table'`` tends to be faster than `kind='sort'` if the
    following relationship is true:
    ``log10(len(test_elements)) >
    (log10(max(test_elements)-min(test_elements)) - 2.27) / 0.927``,
    but may use greater memory. The default value for `kind` will
    be automatically selected based only on memory usage, so one may
    manually set ``kind='table'`` if memory constraints can be relaxed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> element = 2*np.arange(4).reshape((2, 2))
    >>> element
    array([[0, 2],
           [4, 6]])
    >>> test_elements = [1, 2, 4, 8]
    >>> mask = np.isin(element, test_elements)
    >>> mask
    array([[False,  True],
           [ True, False]])
    >>> element[mask]
    array([2, 4])

    The indices of the matched values can be obtained with `nonzero`:

    >>> np.nonzero(mask)
    (array([0, 1]), array([1, 0]))

    The test can also be inverted:

    >>> mask = np.isin(element, test_elements, invert=True)
    >>> mask
    array([[ True, False],
           [False,  True]])
    >>> element[mask]
    array([0, 6])

    Because of how `array` handles sets, the following does not
    work as expected:

    >>> test_set = {1, 2, 4, 8}
    >>> np.isin(element, test_set)
    array([[False, False],
           [False, False]])

    Casting the set to a list gives the expected result:

    >>> np.isin(element, list(test_set))
    array([[False,  True],
           [ True, False]])

Binary serialization

NPY format
==========

A simple format for saving numpy arrays to disk with the full
information about them.

The ``.npy`` format is the standard binary file format in NumPy for
persisting a *single* arbitrary NumPy array on disk. The format stores all
of the shape and dtype information necessary to reconstruct the array
correctly even on another machine with a different architecture.
The format is designed to be as simple as possible while achieving
its limited goals.

The ``.npz`` format is the standard format for persisting *multiple* NumPy
arrays on disk. A ``.npz`` file is a zip file containing multiple ``.npy``
files, one for each array.

Capabilities
------------

- Can represent all NumPy arrays including nested record arrays and
  object arrays.

- Represents the data in its native binary form.

- Supports Fortran-contiguous arrays directly.

- Stores all of the necessary information to reconstruct the array
  including shape and dtype on a machine of a different
  architecture.  Both little-endian and big-endian arrays are
  supported, and a file with little-endian numbers will yield
  a little-endian array on any machine reading the file. The
  types are described in terms of their actual sizes. For example,
  if a machine with a 64-bit C "long int" writes out an array with
  "long ints", a reading machine with 32-bit C "long ints" will yield
  an array with 64-bit integers.

- Is straightforward to reverse engineer. Datasets often live longer than
  the programs that created them. A competent developer should be
  able to create a solution in their preferred programming language to
  read most ``.npy`` files that they have been given without much
  documentation.

- Allows memory-mapping of the data. See `open_memmap`.

- Can be read from a filelike stream object instead of an actual file.

- Stores object arrays, i.e. arrays containing elements that are arbitrary
  Python objects. Files with object arrays are not to be mmapable, but
  can be read and written to disk.

Limitations
-----------

- Arbitrary subclasses of numpy.ndarray are not completely preserved.
  Subclasses will be accepted for writing, but only the array data will
  be written out. A regular numpy.ndarray object will be created
  upon reading the file.

.. warning::

  Due to limitations in the interpretation of structured dtypes, dtypes
  with fields with empty names will have the names replaced by 'f0', 'f1',
  etc. Such arrays will not round-trip through the format entirely
  accurately. The data is intact; only the field names will differ. We are
  working on a fix for this. This fix will not require a change in the
  file format. The arrays with such structures can still be saved and
  restored, and the correct dtype may be restored by using the
  ``loadedarray.view(correct_dtype)`` method.

File extensions
---------------

We recommend using the ``.npy`` and ``.npz`` extensions for files saved
in this format. This is by no means a requirement; applications may wish
to use these file formats but use an extension specific to the
application. In the absence of an obvious alternative, however,
we suggest using ``.npy`` and ``.npz``.

Version numbering
-----------------

The version numbering of these formats is independent of NumPy version
numbering. If the format is upgraded, the code in `numpy.io` will still
be able to read and write Version 1.0 files.

Format Version 1.0
------------------

The first 6 bytes are a magic string: exactly ``\\x93NUMPY``.

The next 1 byte is an unsigned byte: the major version number of the file
format, e.g. ``\\x01``.

The next 1 byte is an unsigned byte: the minor version number of the file
format, e.g. ``\\x00``. Note: the version of the file format is not tied
to the version of the numpy package.

The next 2 bytes form a little-endian unsigned short int: the length of
the header data HEADER_LEN.

The next HEADER_LEN bytes form the header data describing the array's
format. It is an ASCII string which contains a Python literal expression
of a dictionary. It is terminated by a newline (``\\n``) and padded with
spaces (``\\x20``) to make the total of
``len(magic string) + 2 + len(length) + HEADER_LEN`` be evenly divisible
by 64 for alignment purposes.

The dictionary contains three keys:

    "descr" : dtype.descr
      An object that can be passed as an argument to the `numpy.dtype`
      constructor to create the array's dtype.
    "fortran_order" : bool
      Whether the array data is Fortran-contiguous or not. Since
      Fortran-contiguous arrays are a common form of non-C-contiguity,
      we allow them to be written directly to disk for efficiency.
    "shape" : tuple of int
      The shape of the array.

For repeatability and readability, the dictionary keys are sorted in
alphabetic order. This is for convenience only. A writer SHOULD implement
this if possible. A reader MUST NOT depend on this.

Following the header comes the array data. If the dtype contains Python
objects (i.e. ``dtype.hasobject is True``), then the data is a Python
pickle of the array. Otherwise the data is the contiguous (either C-
or Fortran-, depending on ``fortran_order``) bytes of the array.
Consumers can figure out the number of bytes by multiplying the number
of elements given by the shape (noting that ``shape=()`` means there is
1 element) by ``dtype.itemsize``.

Format Version 2.0
------------------

The version 1.0 format only allowed the array header to have a total size of
65535 bytes.  This can be exceeded by structured arrays with a large number of
columns.  The version 2.0 format extends the header size to 4 GiB.
`numpy.save` will automatically save in 2.0 format if the data requires it,
else it will always use the more compatible 1.0 format.

The description of the fourth element of the header therefore has become:
"The next 4 bytes form a little-endian unsigned int: the length of the header
data HEADER_LEN."

Format Version 3.0
------------------

This version replaces the ASCII string (which in practice was latin1) with
a utf8-encoded string, so supports structured types with any unicode field
names.

Notes
-----
The ``.npy`` format, including motivation for creating it and a comparison of
alternatives, is described in the
:doc:`"npy-format" NEP <neps:nep-0001-npy-format>`, however details have
evolved with time and this document is more current.

    Open a .npy file as a memory-mapped array.

    This may be used to read an existing file or create a new one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str or path-like
        The name of the file on disk.  This may *not* be a file-like
        object.
    mode : str, optional
        The mode in which to open the file; the default is 'r+'.  In
        addition to the standard file modes, 'c' is also accepted to mean
        "copy on write."  See `memmap` for the available mode strings.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The data type of the array if we are creating a new file in "write"
        mode, if not, `dtype` is ignored.  The default value is None, which
        results in a data-type of `float64`.
    shape : tuple of int
        The shape of the array if we are creating a new file in "write"
        mode, in which case this parameter is required.  Otherwise, this
        parameter is ignored and is thus optional.
    fortran_order : bool, optional
        Whether the array should be Fortran-contiguous (True) or
        C-contiguous (False, the default) if we are creating a new file in
        "write" mode.
    version : tuple of int (major, minor) or None
        If the mode is a "write" mode, then this is the version of the file
        format used to create the file.  None means use the oldest
        supported version that is able to store the data.  Default: None
    max_header_size : int, optional
        Maximum allowed size of the header.  Large headers may not be safe
        to load securely and thus require explicitly passing a larger value.
        See :py:func:`ast.literal_eval()` for details.

    Returns
    -------
    marray : memmap
        The memory-mapped array.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the data or the mode is invalid.

    Generate a Vandermonde matrix.

    The columns of the output matrix are powers of the input vector. The
    order of the powers is determined by the `increasing` boolean argument.
    Specifically, when `increasing` is False, the `i`-th output column is
    the input vector raised element-wise to the power of ``N - i - 1``. Such
    a matrix with a geometric progression in each row is named for Alexandre-
    Theophile Vandermonde.

    N : int, optional

    increasing : bool, optional
        Order of the powers of the columns.  If True, the powers increase
        from left to right, if False (the default) they are reversed.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray

        The bin edges along the second dimension.

    histogram : 1D histogram
    histogramdd : Multidimensional histogram

    Notes
    -----
    When `density` is True, then the returned histogram is the sample
    density, defined such that the sum over bins of the product
    ``bin_value * bin_area`` is 1.

    Please note that the histogram does not follow the Cartesian convention
    where `x` values are on the abscissa and `y` values on the ordinate
    axis.  Rather, `x` is histogrammed along the first dimension of the
    array (vertical), and `y` along the second dimension of the array
    (horizontal).  This ensures compatibility with `histogramdd`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from matplotlib.image import NonUniformImage
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    Construct a 2-D histogram with variable bin width. First define the bin
    edges:

    >>> xedges = [0, 1, 3, 5]
    >>> yedges = [0, 2, 3, 4, 6]

    Next we create a histogram H with random bin content:

    >>> x = np.random.normal(2, 1, 100)
    >>> y = np.random.normal(1, 1, 100)
    >>> H, xedges, yedges = np.histogram2d(x, y, bins=(xedges, yedges))
    >>> # Histogram does not follow Cartesian convention (see Notes),
    >>> # therefore transpose H for visualization purposes.
    >>> H = H.T

    :func:`imshow <matplotlib.pyplot.imshow>` can only display square bins:

    >>> fig = plt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))
    >>> ax = fig.add_subplot(131, title='imshow: square bins')
    >>> plt.imshow(H, interpolation='nearest', origin='lower',
    ...         extent=[xedges[0], xedges[-1], yedges[0], yedges[-1]])
    <matplotlib.image.AxesImage object at 0x...>

    :func:`pcolormesh <matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh>` can display actual edges:

    >>> ax = fig.add_subplot(132, title='pcolormesh: actual edges',
    ...         aspect='equal')
    >>> X, Y = np.meshgrid(xedges, yedges)
    >>> ax.pcolormesh(X, Y, H)
    <matplotlib.collections.QuadMesh object at 0x...>

    :class:`NonUniformImage <matplotlib.image.NonUniformImage>` can be used to
    display actual bin edges with interpolation:

    >>> ax = fig.add_subplot(133, title='NonUniformImage: interpolated',
    ...         aspect='equal', xlim=xedges[[0, -1]], ylim=yedges[[0, -1]])
    >>> im = NonUniformImage(ax, interpolation='bilinear')
    >>> xcenters = (xedges[:-1] + xedges[1:]) / 2
    >>> ycenters = (yedges[:-1] + yedges[1:]) / 2
    >>> im.set_data(xcenters, ycenters, H)
    >>> ax.add_image(im)
    >>> plt.show()

    It is also possible to construct a 2-D histogram without specifying bin
    edges:

    >>> # Generate non-symmetric test data
    >>> n = 10000
    >>> x = np.linspace(1, 100, n)
    >>> y = 2*np.log(x) + np.random.rand(n) - 0.5
    >>> # Compute 2d histogram. Note the order of x/y and xedges/yedges
    >>> H, yedges, xedges = np.histogram2d(y, x, bins=20)

    Now we can plot the histogram using
    :func:`pcolormesh <matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh>`, and a
    :func:`hexbin <matplotlib.pyplot.hexbin>` for comparison.

    >>> # Plot histogram using pcolormesh
    >>> fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, sharey=True)
    >>> ax1.pcolormesh(xedges, yedges, H, cmap='rainbow')
    >>> ax1.plot(x, 2*np.log(x), 'k-')
    >>> ax1.set_xlim(x.min(), x.max())
    >>> ax1.set_ylim(y.min(), y.max())
    >>> ax1.set_xlabel('x')
    >>> ax1.set_ylabel('y')
    >>> ax1.set_title('histogram2d')
    >>> ax1.grid()

    >>> # Create hexbin plot for comparison
    >>> ax2.hexbin(x, y, gridsize=20, cmap='rainbow')
    >>> ax2.plot(x, 2*np.log(x), 'k-')
    >>> ax2.set_title('hexbin')
    >>> ax2.set_xlim(x.min(), x.max())
    >>> ax2.set_xlabel('x')
    >>> ax2.grid()

    >>> plt.show()

def mask_indices(n, mask_func, k=0):
    """
    Return the indices to access (n, n) arrays, given a masking function.

    Assume `mask_func` is a function that, for a square array a of size
    ``(n, n)`` with a possible offset argument `k`, when called as
    ``mask_func(a, k)`` returns a new array with zeros in certain locations
    (functions like `triu` or `tril` do precisely this). Then this function
    returns the indices where the non-zero values would be located.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The returned indices will be valid to access arrays of shape (n, n).
    mask_func : callable
        A function whose call signature is similar to that of `triu`, `tril`.
        That is, ``mask_func(x, k)`` returns a boolean array, shaped like `x`.
        `k` is an optional argument to the function.
    k : scalar
        An optional argument which is passed through to `mask_func`. Functions
        like `triu`, `tril` take a second argument that is interpreted as an
        offset.

    Returns
    -------
    indices : tuple of arrays.
        The `n` arrays of indices corresponding to the locations where
        ``mask_func(np.ones((n, n)), k)`` is True.

    See Also
    --------
    triu, tril, triu_indices, tril_indices

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np

    These are the indices that would allow you to access the upper triangular
    part of any 3x3 array:

    >>> iu = np.mask_indices(3, np.triu)

    For example, if `a` is a 3x3 array:

    >>> a = np.arange(9).reshape(3, 3)
    >>> a
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [3, 4, 5],
           [6, 7, 8]])
    >>> a[iu]
    array([0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 8])

    An offset can be passed also to the masking function.  This gets us the
    indices starting on the first diagonal right of the main one:

    >>> iu1 = np.mask_indices(3, np.triu, 1)

    with which we now extract only three elements:

    Notes
    -----
    ``as_strided`` creates a view into the array given the exact strides
    and shape. This means it manipulates the internal data structure of
    ndarray and, if done incorrectly, the array elements can point to
    invalid memory and can corrupt results or crash your program.
    It is advisable to always use the original ``x.strides`` when
    calculating new strides to avoid reliance on a contiguous memory
    layout.

    Furthermore, arrays created with this function often contain self
    overlapping memory, so that two elements are identical.
    Vectorized write operations on such arrays will typically be
    unpredictable. They may even give different results for small, large,
    or transposed arrays.

    Since writing to these arrays has to be tested and done with great
    care, you may want to use ``writeable=False`` to avoid accidental write
    operations.

    For these reasons it is advisable to avoid ``as_strided`` when
    possible.

        Array to create the sliding window view from.
    window_shape : int or tuple of int
        Size of window over each axis that takes part in the sliding window.
        If `axis` is not present, must have same length as the number of input
        array dimensions. Single integers `i` are treated as if they were the
        tuple `(i,)`.
    axis : int or tuple of int, optional
        Axis or axes along which the sliding window is applied.
        By default, the sliding window is applied to all axes and
        `window_shape[i]` will refer to axis `i` of `x`.
        If `axis` is given as a `tuple of int`, `window_shape[i]` will refer to
        the axis `axis[i]` of `x`.
        Single integers `i` are treated as if they were the tuple `(i,)`.
    subok : bool, optional
        If True, sub-classes will be passed-through, otherwise the returned
        array will be forced to be a base-class array (default).
    writeable : bool, optional
        When true, allow writing to the returned view. The default is false,
        as this should be used with caution: the returned view contains the
        same memory location multiple times, so writing to one location will
        cause others to change.

    Returns
    -------
    view : ndarray
        Sliding window view of the array. The sliding window dimensions are
        inserted at the end, and the original dimensions are trimmed as
        required by the size of the sliding window.
        That is, ``view.shape = x_shape_trimmed + window_shape``, where
        ``x_shape_trimmed`` is ``x.shape`` with every entry reduced by one less
        than the corresponding window size.

    See Also
    --------
    lib.stride_tricks.as_strided: A lower-level and less safe routine for
        creating arbitrary views from custom shape and strides.
    broadcast_to: broadcast an array to a given shape.

    Notes
    -----
    For many applications using a sliding window view can be convenient, but
    potentially very slow. Often specialized solutions exist, for example:

    - `scipy.signal.fftconvolve`

    - filtering functions in `scipy.ndimage`

    - moving window functions provided by
      `bottleneck <https://github.com/pydata/bottleneck>`_.

    As a rough estimate, a sliding window approach with an input size of `N`
    and a window size of `W` will scale as `O(N*W)` where frequently a special
    algorithm can achieve `O(N)`. That means that the sliding window variant
    for a window size of 100 can be a 100 times slower than a more specialized
    version.

    Nevertheless, for small window sizes, when no custom algorithm exists, or
    as a prototyping and developing tool, this function can be a good solution.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from numpy.lib.stride_tricks import sliding_window_view
    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> x.shape
    (6,)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3)
    >>> v.shape
    (4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [3, 4, 5]])

    This also works in more dimensions, e.g.

    >>> i, j = np.ogrid[:3, :4]
    >>> x = 10*i + j
    >>> x.shape
    (3, 4)
    >>> x
    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3],
           [10, 11, 12, 13],
           [20, 21, 22, 23]])
    >>> shape = (2,2)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, shape)
    >>> v.shape
    (2, 3, 2, 2)
    >>> v
    array([[[[ 0,  1],
             [10, 11]],
            [[ 1,  2],
             [11, 12]],
            [[ 2,  3],
             [12, 13]]],
           [[[10, 11],
             [20, 21]],
            [[11, 12],
             [21, 22]],
            [[12, 13],
             [22, 23]]]])

    The axis can be specified explicitly:

    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3, 0)
    >>> v.shape
    (1, 4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[[ 0, 10, 20],
            [ 1, 11, 21],
            [ 2, 12, 22],
            [ 3, 13, 23]]])

    The same axis can be used several times. In that case, every use reduces
    the corresponding original dimension:

    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, (2, 3), (1, 1))
    >>> v.shape
    (3, 1, 2, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[[[ 0,  1,  2],
             [ 1,  2,  3]]],
           [[[10, 11, 12],
             [11, 12, 13]]],
           [[[20, 21, 22],
             [21, 22, 23]]]])

    Combining with stepped slicing (`::step`), this can be used to take sliding
    views which skip elements:

    >>> x = np.arange(7)
    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 5)[:, ::2]
    array([[0, 2, 4],
           [1, 3, 5],
           [2, 4, 6]])

    or views which move by multiple elements

    >>> x = np.arange(7)
    >>> sliding_window_view(x, 3)[::2, :]
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [4, 5, 6]])

    A common application of `sliding_window_view` is the calculation of running
    statistics. The simplest example is the
    `moving average <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average>`_:

    >>> x = np.arange(6)
    >>> x.shape
    (6,)
    >>> v = sliding_window_view(x, 3)
    >>> v.shape
    (4, 3)
    >>> v
    array([[0, 1, 2],
           [1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4],
           [3, 4, 5]])
    >>> moving_average = v.mean(axis=-1)
    >>> moving_average
    array([1., 2., 3., 4.])

    Note that a sliding window approach is often **not** optimal (see Notes).

def repack_fields(a, align=False, recurse=False):
    """
    Re-pack the fields of a structured array or dtype in memory.

    The memory layout of structured datatypes allows fields at arbitrary
    byte offsets. This means the fields can be separated by padding bytes,
    their offsets can be non-monotonically increasing, and they can overlap.

    This method removes any overlaps and reorders the fields in memory so they
    have increasing byte offsets, and adds or removes padding bytes depending
    on the `align` option, which behaves like the `align` option to
    `numpy.dtype`.

    If `align=False`, this method produces a "packed" memory layout in which
    each field starts at the byte the previous field ended, and any padding
    bytes are removed.

    If `align=True`, this methods produces an "aligned" memory layout in which
    each field's offset is a multiple of its alignment, and the total itemsize
    is a multiple of the largest alignment, by adding padding bytes as needed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray or dtype
       array or dtype for which to repack the fields.
    align : boolean
       If true, use an "aligned" memory layout, otherwise use a "packed" layout.
    recurse : boolean
       If True, also repack nested structures.

    Returns
    -------
    repacked : ndarray or dtype
       Copy of `a` with fields repacked, or `a` itself if no repacking was
       needed.

    Assigns values from one structured array to another by field name.

    Normally in numpy >= 1.14, assignment of one structured array to another

Wrapper functions to more user-friendly calling of certain math functions
whose output data-type is different than the input data-type in certain
domains of the input.

For example, for functions like `log` with branch cuts, the versions in this
module provide the mathematically valid answers in the complex plane::

  >>> import math
  >>> np.emath.log(-math.exp(1)) == (1+1j*math.pi)
  True

Similarly, `sqrt`, other base logarithms, `power` and trig functions are
correctly handled.  See their respective docstrings for specific examples.
