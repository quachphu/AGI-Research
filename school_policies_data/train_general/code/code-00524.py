- seems to contain a bug when updating...

- reclaim free space (currently, space once occupied by deleted or expanded

- support concurrent access (currently, if two processes take turns making

- support efficient access to large databases (currently, the whole index

The returned object is a dbm.gnu, dbm.ndbm or dbm.dumb object, dependent on the
type of database being opened (determined by the whichdb function) in the case
of an existing dbm. If the dbm does not exist and the create or new flag ('c'
or 'n') was specified, the dbm type will be determined by the availability of
the modules (tested in the above order).

It has the following interface (key and data are strings):

        d[key] = data   # store data at key (may override data at
                        # existing key)
        data = d[key]   # retrieve data at key (raise KeyError if no
                        # such key)
        del d[key]      # delete data stored at key (raises KeyError
                        # if no such key)
        flag = key in d # true if the key exists
        list = d.keys() # return a list of all existing keys (slow!)

Future versions may change the order in which implementations are
tested for existence, and add interfaces to other dbm-like
implementations.

attributes of the HTTP cookie system as cookie-attributes, to distinguish
them clearly from Python attributes.

    The function knows how to deal with ",", ";" and "=" as well as quoted
    values after "=".  A list of space separated tokens are parsed as if they
    were separated by ";".

    If the header_values passed as argument contains multiple values, then they
    are treated as if they were a single value separated by comma ",".

    This means that this function is useful for parsing header fields that
    follow this syntax (BNF as from the HTTP/1.1 specification, but we relax
    the requirement for tokens).

      headers           = #header
      header            = (token | parameter) *( [";"] (token | parameter))

    Each header is represented by a list of key/value pairs.  The value for a
    simple token (not part of a parameter) is None.  Syntactically incorrect
    headers will not necessarily be parsed as you would want.

    This is easier to describe with some examples:

    WARNING: you may want to backup your browser's cookies file if you use
    this class to save cookies.  I *think* it works, but there have been
    bugs in the past!

    This class differs from CookieJar only in the format it uses to save and
    load cookies to and from a file.  This class uses the Mozilla/Netscape
    `cookies.txt' format.  curl and lynx use this file format, too.

    Don't expect cookies saved while the browser is running to be noticed by
    the browser (in fact, Mozilla on unix will overwrite your saved cookies if
    you change them on disk while it's running; on Windows, you probably can't
    save at all while the browser is running).

    Note that the Mozilla/Netscape format will downgrade RFC2965 cookies to
    Netscape cookies on saving.

    In particular, the cookie version and port number information is lost,
    together with information about whether or not Path, Port and Discard were
    specified by the Set-Cookie2 (or Set-Cookie) header, and whether or not the
    domain as set in the HTTP header started with a dot (yes, I'm aware some
    domains in Netscape files start with a dot and some don't -- trust me, you
    really don't want to know any more about this).

    Note that though Mozilla and Netscape use the same format, they use
    slightly different headers.  The class saves cookies using the Netscape
    header by default (Mozilla can cope with that).

#
#  Cookie.py is a Python module for the handling of HTTP
#  cookies as a Python dictionary.  See RFC 2109 for more
#  information on cookies.
#
#  The original idea to treat Cookies as a dictionary came from
#  Dave Mitchell (davem@magnet.com) in 1995, when he released the
#  first version of nscookie.py.
#
####

r"""
Here's a sample session to show how to use this module.
At the moment, this is the only documentation.

The Basics
----------

Importing is easy...

   >>> from http import cookies

Most of the time you start by creating a cookie.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()

Once you've created your Cookie, you can add values just as if it were
a dictionary.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["fig"] = "newton"
   >>> C["sugar"] = "wafer"
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: fig=newton\r\nSet-Cookie: sugar=wafer'

Notice that the printable representation of a Cookie is the
appropriate format for a Set-Cookie: header.  This is the
default behavior.  You can change the header and printed
attributes by using the .output() function

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["rocky"] = "road"
   >>> C["rocky"]["path"] = "/cookie"
   >>> print(C.output(header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road; Path=/cookie
   >>> print(C.output(attrs=[], header="Cookie:"))
   Cookie: rocky=road

The load() method of a Cookie extracts cookies from a string.  In a
CGI script, you would use this method to extract the cookies from the
HTTP_COOKIE environment variable.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load("chips=ahoy; vienna=finger")
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: chips=ahoy\r\nSet-Cookie: vienna=finger'

The load() method is darn-tootin smart about identifying cookies
within a string.  Escaped quotation marks, nested semicolons, and other
such trickeries do not confuse it.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C.load('keebler="E=everybody; L=\\"Loves\\"; fudge=;";')
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: keebler="E=everybody; L=\"Loves\"; fudge=;"

Each element of the Cookie also supports all of the RFC 2109
Cookie attributes.  Here's an example which sets the Path
attribute.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["oreo"] = "doublestuff"
   >>> C["oreo"]["path"] = "/"
   >>> print(C)
   Set-Cookie: oreo=doublestuff; Path=/

Each dictionary element has a 'value' attribute, which gives you
back the value associated with the key.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["twix"] = "none for you"
   >>> C["twix"].value
   'none for you'

The SimpleCookie expects that all values should be standard strings.
Just to be sure, SimpleCookie invokes the str() builtin to convert
the value to a string, when the values are set dictionary-style.

   >>> C = cookies.SimpleCookie()
   >>> C["number"] = 7
   >>> C["string"] = "seven"
   >>> C["number"].value
   '7'
   >>> C["string"].value
   'seven'
   >>> C.output()
   'Set-Cookie: number=7\r\nSet-Cookie: string=seven'

<intro stuff goes here>
<other stuff, too>

HTTPConnection goes through a number of "states", which define when a client
may legally make another request or fetch the response for a particular
request. This diagram details these state transitions:

    (null)
      |
      | HTTPConnection()
      v
    Idle
      |
      | putrequest()
      v
    Request-started
      |
      | ( putheader() )*  endheaders()
      v
    Request-sent
      |\_____________________________
      |                              | getresponse() raises
      | response = getresponse()     | ConnectionError
      v                              v
    Unread-response                Idle
    [Response-headers-read]
      |\____________________
      |                     |
      | response.read()     | putrequest()
      v                     v
    Idle                  Req-started-unread-response
                     ______/|
                   /        |
   response.read() |        | ( putheader() )*  endheaders()
                   v        v
       Request-started    Req-sent-unread-response
                            |
                            | response.read()
                            v
                          Request-sent

This diagram presents the following rules:
  -- a second request may not be started until {response-headers-read}
  -- a response [object] cannot be retrieved until {request-sent}
  -- there is no differentiation between an unread response body and a
     partially read response body

Note: this enforcement is applied by the HTTPConnection class. The
      HTTPResponse class does not enforce this state machine, which
      implies sophisticated clients may accelerate the request/response
      pipeline. Caution should be taken, though: accelerating the states
      beyond the above pattern may imply knowledge of the server's
      connection-close behavior for certain requests. For example, it
      is impossible to tell whether the server will close the connection
      UNTIL the response headers have been read; this means that further
      requests cannot be placed into the pipeline until it is known that
      the server will NOT be closing the connection.

Logical State                  __state            __response
